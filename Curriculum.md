### **Chapter 1: Foundations in Fluid Mechanics & Classical Simulation**

**(Focus: Understanding basic fluid behavior and how traditional simulators work, generating initial data.)**

*   **Theory:**
    *   **Core Fluid Dynamics Concepts:**
        *   Definition of a fluid, continuum hypothesis.
        *   Basic fluid properties: density, viscosity (dynamic/kinematic), pressure, temperature, surface tension. Units and dimensions.
        *   Fluid statics (fluids at rest) vs. fluid dynamics (fluids in motion).
        *   Incompressible flow and the continuity equation (`∇ · u = 0`). For water simulation in games, particularly at typical speeds and pressures, assuming incompressible flow is often a reasonable simplification.
        *   The Navier-Stokes equations: Conceptual understanding as the fundamental equations of motion for viscous fluids, expressing conservation of momentum and mass. They consist of terms representing inertia, pressure gradients, viscous forces, and external forces. Understanding that ML models aim to approximate solutions to these equations is a crucial theoretical foundation.
        *   Eulerian vs. Lagrangian perspectives for describing fluid flow.
        *   Fluid flow characteristics: Laminar flow (smooth, orderly) vs. Turbulent flow (chaotic, disordered, eddies). Modeling turbulence is a significant challenge where ML is actively explored.
        *   Boundary Conditions: Their critical role in defining fluid flow problems (e.g., no-slip condition at solid walls, conditions at free surfaces). ML models must learn to respect these for physically plausible simulations.
        *   (Optional) Shallow Water Equations basics: assumptions, what they model.
    *   **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Overview (for data generation context):**
        *   Conceptual introduction to numerical methods used to simulate fluid flow: finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods. These methods work by discretizing the governing equations and the flow domain into a grid or mesh, then numerically solving the equations at discrete points in space and time.
        *   Brief overview of common CFD software (e.g., OpenFOAM, Ansys Fluent) – the goal is to understand tools that *generate* data for ML, not to become an expert in using them. ML models can be trained on data from these simulations or integrated into CFD workflows.
    *   **Particle-Based Simulation Methods:**
        *   Introduction to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH): Core idea of representing a fluid as a collection of interacting particles, where each particle carries fluid properties. Key concepts include kernel functions for smoothing, density estimation, and calculation of pressure and viscosity forces. SPH excels at simulating splashing and free surface effects.
        *   Other relevant particle methods (brief overview, e.g., Position Based Dynamics - PBD).
    *   **Discretization and Numerical Stability (Conceptual):**
        *   Brief introduction to how continuous equations are solved on computers (time steps, spatial discretization).
        *   Concept of numerical stability (avoiding error amplification) and convergence (solution approaching true solution as discretization refines).

*   **Practice (Hands-on):**
    1.  **Fluid Observation & Problem Solving:**
        *   Solve simple problems related to fluid properties (e.g., calculating hydrostatic pressure at a specific depth in water).
        *   Identify different types of fluid flow (e.g., laminar flow from a tap, turbulent flow in river rapids) in everyday scenarios.
        *   Explore online resources and interactive simulations that visually demonstrate fluid properties.
    2.  **Experimenting with a 2D SPH Simulator:**
        *   Set up and run a pre-existing 2D SPH simulator (e.g., **SPlisHSPlasH** with Python bindings, **PySPH**, or other available open-source tools or programming libraries suitable for beginners with strong ML skills).
        *   Simulate basic scenarios: a dam break, a droplet falling, generating waves.
        *   Focus on:
            *   Understanding input parameters (particle count, stiffness, viscosity, timestep, smoothing length, particle mass).
            *   Observing the resulting particle behavior and interactions.
            *   Learning how to extract particle data (positions, velocities, accelerations) over time.
        *   **Goal:** Generate a small, manageable 2D dataset of particle trajectories that can be used in Chapter 2. Visualize the SPH simulation output.

    *   **Representing Particle Systems as Graphs:**
        *   Particles as nodes (node features: current position (x, y, [z]), current velocity (vx, vy, [vz]), mass, particle type – e.g., fluid, boundary).
        *   Interactions/Proximity as edges (edge features: relative displacement vector between particles (dx, dy, [dz]), Euclidean distance).
    *   **Core GNN Mechanisms:**
        *   Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs): Conceptual understanding of how information is exchanged between connected nodes (aggregate information from neighbors, update node states).
        *   Introduction to GNN Layers:
            *   Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) - brief conceptual introduction.
            *   Graph Attention Networks (GATs) - brief conceptual introduction, noting their use of attention mechanisms to assign weights to neighboring nodes, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant interactions for predicting flow (useful for capturing non-equilibrium features).
    *   **Input/Output for Physics Simulation with GNNs:** Commonly predicting accelerations, which are then integrated (often by a simple Euler step in the GNN's decoder or externally) to find the next velocities or positions.
    *   **Inductive Biases for Physical Systems:** How GNN structure (e.g., operating on local neighborhoods defined by edges) inherently incorporates prior knowledge or assumptions to improve learning and generalization in physics applications.

*   **Practice (Hands-on):**
    1.  **Toy GNN Implementation:**

        *   Practice working with graph data structures using libraries such as **NetworkX** (for graph creation/manipulation) or PyTorch Geometric/DGL.
        *   Experiment with simple GNN models on synthetic or toy graph datasets to understand the fundamentals of graph-based learning.
    2.  **Simple GNN for 2D Particle Data:**
        *   Use the **2D particle data generated in Chapter 1** or some 2D particle dataset.
        *   Represent a single timestep (or a short sequence of timesteps) as a graph.
        *   Implement a basic GNN (e.g., an MLP applied to aggregated neighbor features, or a single GCN layer) to predict the *next velocity* or *acceleration* of each particle from its current state and its neighbors' states.
        *   **Goal:** Get familiar with processing particle data into graph format and performing a basic learning task using GNNs. This is about understanding the GNN mechanics with relevant data, not creating a perfect simulator yet.
